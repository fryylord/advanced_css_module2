## Solution for Module 2 Challenge

This site has been created as the landing page for my personal portfolio to showcase my various projects throughout the KU Coding Bootcamp and any other side projects I undertake.  Eventually it will have links to the all the projects I have completed, rather than having placeholders for the majority of the objects.

## Installation

All you need is the index.html file, allong with the directory assets.  These should be in the parent repository directory, with assets being a child directly within the parent.

## Usage

To showcase my abilities and progress made throughout my time while participating in the coding bootcamp.  

## Credits

While much of this was assembled on my own, various pieces of source code from https://ku.bootcampcontent.com/ku-coding-boot-camp/KU-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2022-U-LOLC/ have been used.
